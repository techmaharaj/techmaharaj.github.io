Hi there 

Thanks for dropping by. I'm sure you're curious to know who am I and what I do. I'm Atul, a developer relations professional for about 3 years now. I'm currently working as a Senior Developer Advocate at InfraCloud. 

I'm also a CNCF Ambassador where I'm involved in a lot of community activities from organizing meetups to speaking at events, doing webinars and things like that to help individuals and organizations adopt cloud native technologies. 

I've worn different hats over my decade long career. Started out as a manual tester where I was responsiblef for testing web portals. Later moved to automation testing where I used a proprietory framework using C#. Later I also build websites using HTML, Javascript and Bootstrap. I have some exposure to business analytics and reporting as well - worked on a dashboarding project using Power BI along with Azure Data Factory. Was also involved in building and maintaining Android App using Xamarin framework. I've also developed and published apps on the Android Play Store.

I've been a content creator for a couple of decades now sharing my live experiences on my blog [socialmaharaj.com](https://socialmaharaj.com). I understand how the digital marketing landscape works - from SEO to content tips and tricks. I eat and breath content and enjoy writing, shooting videos and I'm relatively active on social media as well.
