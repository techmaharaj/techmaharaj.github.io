Hi there 

Thanks for dropping by. I'm sure you're curious to know who am I and what I do. I'm Atul, a developer relations professional for about 3 years now. I'm currently working as a **Senior Developer Advocate** at **InfraCloud**. 

I'm also a **CNCF Ambassador** where I'm involved in a lot of community activities from organizing meetups to speaking at events, doing webinars and things that help individuals and organizations adopt cloud native technologies. 

In my current role, I've:

- spoken at a **panel discussion** on platform engineering at **KubeCon Paris 2024**
- delivered a talk at **CloudNative Rejekts in Chicago 2023**
- spoken at **KCD Chennai, KCD Pune, KCD Pakistan** and a lot of other conferences and meetups
- organized meetups in Hyderabad as an **organizer of Cloud Native Hyderabad community**
- conducted **live webinars** on platform engineering, service mesh, etc.
- published numerous **blog posts** on sites like **TheNewStack**, **PlatformEngineering.org** to name a few

I've worn different hats over my **decade long career**, here's a short snippet of it:

- Started out as a manual tester where I was responsiblef for testing web portals. 
- Later moved to automation testing where I used a proprietory framework using C#. 
- Later I also build websites using HTML, Javascript and Bootstrap. 
- I have some exposure to business analytics and reporting as well - *worked on a dashboarding project using Power BI along with Azure Data Factory*.
- Was also involved in building and maintaining Android App using Xamarin framework. I've also developed and published apps on the Android Play Store.

I've been a **content creator** for a couple of decades now sharing my live experiences on my blog [socialmaharaj.com](https://socialmaharaj.com), [Instagram](httpsL//instagram.com/Atulmaharaj) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Atulmaharaj). I understand how the digital marketing landscape works - *from SEO to content tips and tricks*. I eat and breath content and enjoy writing, shooting videos and I'm relatively active on social media as well. 

I hold a degree in computer science (B.Tech) and business administration (PGDM) with a specialization in marketing.
